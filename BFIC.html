    <h1>The Best Buffalo Chicken Ice Cream You Can Find</h1>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>It has come to my attention that too few people are utilizing 
    the combination of Buffalo Chicken and Ice Cream.  In this 
    recipe, we will show you how to make the best Buffalo Chicken
    Ice Cream this side of the Mississippi!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients you will need:</h3>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Place chicken breasts in a large ziploc bag or between two pieces of plastic wrap and lightly pound until they are of even thickness.</li>
    <li>Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cookie spray. Place chicken breasts in the dish side by side.</li>
    <li>Pour buffalo sauce on top of the chicken (use more or less to your taste).</li>
    <li>Top evenly with shredded Mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and registers 165 degrees on a meat thermometer. (Depending on the thickness of the meat, this could take a few minutes longer).</li>
    <li>Let stand for 5 minutes</li>
    <li>In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).</li>
    <li>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturers’ instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.</li>
    <li>Put finished Ice Cream in the largest blender you can find.  Combine the finished Buffalo Chicken into the bowl.  Mix until 
        at premium consistency.  Mmmmmmmmm yummy!!!</li>
